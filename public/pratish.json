    "about": "I‚Äôm a versatile full‚Äëstack Software Engineer based in Bengaluru with over two years of hands‚Äëon experience building scalable, user‚Äëcentered web applications. At Celstream Technologies, I‚Äôve led the development of high‚Äëtraffic React/Node.js solutions on AWS‚Äîdelivering performance‚Äëcritical features that cut load times by 25%, architecting real‚Äëtime dashboards that improved page speed by 50%, and mentoring junior developers to ship production‚Äëready code in record time. During my internship at Neonflake, I designed and implemented a secure, full‚Äëfeatured e‚Äëcommerce platform from Figma wireframes, leveraging Redis caching for a 95%+ API speedup and crafting a fully responsive UI that boosted user engagement by 35%. Outside of work, I‚Äôve built ‚ÄúQR‚ÄØDine,‚Äù a Next.js and Stripe‚Äìpowered restaurant SaaS, and an Expense Tracker using the MERN stack and Redux to help users manage finances intuitively. I‚Äôm comfortable across modern web ecosystems (React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js, Python/Flask) and backed by Udemy‚Äôs ‚ÄúReact‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØThe Complete Guide‚Äù and Lyft‚Äôs backend virtual experience certification. Whether optimizing CDNs and code‚Äësplitting for lightning‚Äëfast experiences or architecting microservices with JWT‚Äësecure APIs and in‚Äëmemory data handling, I‚Äôm passionate about bridging technical excellence with elegant, user‚Äëfocused design.",
